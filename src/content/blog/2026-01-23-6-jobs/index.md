---------------------------------

Career paths used to be predictable.

Today, they are **conditional**.

Progress depends less on time
and more on perceived indispensability.

---

## Tenure Has Lost Its Power

Staying longer no longer guarantees:

* Protection
* Promotion
* Security

AI erodes the value of familiarity.

---

## Conditional Value Is the New Currency

Modern careers hinge on:

* Context ownership
* Decision accountability
* Relationship trust
* Risk absorption

These cannot be automated easily.

---

## Why This Feels Unsettling

Conditions change silently:

* Teams restructure
* Priorities shift
* Tools evolve

Security feels temporary because it is.

---

## Conclusion

The future of work is not unstable.

It is **selectively stable**.

And stability must now be earned continuously.
