title: "The High Cost of Algorithmic Optimism"
summary: "Why the professional class must focus on the unit economics of human judgment."

------------------------------------------------------

For the past year, one idea has dominated conversations about work:

> *“AI will make everyone more productive.”*

It sounds hopeful.
It feels rational.
And it is dangerously incomplete.

What we are seeing is not universal empowerment, but **algorithmic optimism masking structural job loss**.

---

## Productivity Is Not the Same as Security

Yes, AI increases output.

But productivity gains do not automatically translate into job stability.

In most organizations:

* Output gains flow upward
* Costs are pushed downward
* Risk is transferred to individuals

When one person can now do the work of three, the system does not reward efficiency evenly.

It eliminates redundancy.

## The Professional Class Is Misreading the Moment

For decades, white-collar workers followed a simple rule:

> *Skills protect you.*

AI quietly breaks this assumption.

Because AI does not replace *jobs* —
it compresses **task bundles**.

If your role consists mainly of:

* Writing
* Research
* Summarization
* Coordination
* Reporting

AI does not need to outperform you completely.
It only needs to reduce the **marginal cost of replacing you**.

That threshold has already been crossed.

## The Unit Economics of Human Judgment

Here is the uncomfortable truth:

AI is cheap.
Human judgment is expensive.

Only roles with **high judgment density** remain defensible:

* Decisions with real consequences
* Accountability that cannot be automated
* Context that cannot be scraped
* Responsibility that cannot be delegated

In economic terms:

> You are not paid for output.
> You are paid for *trusted judgment*.

## Why “Learning AI” Is Not a Strategy

Most advice today sounds familiar:

* Learn prompting
* Use AI tools
* Become AI-native

This advice optimizes **efficiency**, not **positioning**.

Efficiency without leverage makes workers:

* Easier to benchmark
* Faster to replace
* Cheaper to substitute

AI skills are no longer differentiation.
They are baseline expectations.

---

## The Quiet Compression Already Underway

Look closely:

* Fewer junior hires
* Thinner middle layers
* Higher output expectations
* Less tolerance for learning curves

This is not a future trend.

This is **labor compression happening now**.

---

## A More Honest Career Strategy

Stop asking:

> “How do I use AI better?”

Start asking:

* Where does my judgment matter?
* What decisions would fail without me?
* What context do I uniquely hold?
* What risk am I trusted to carry?

Then use AI to **support those positions**, not erase them.

---

## Conclusion: Optimism Has a Cost

Algorithmic optimism is comforting.
But comfort delays adaptation.

AI will not eliminate all jobs.
It will expose roles with **low judgment density**.

The future belongs not to the most optimistic —
but to those who understand **where humans remain economically irreplaceable**.
