title: "The Myth of AI-Augmented Workers"
summary: "Why augmentation often means higher expectations, not higher security."

---------------------------------------

“AI will augment workers.”

This phrase sounds supportive.
It is also misleading.

Augmentation rarely reduces pressure.

It raises the bar.

---

## Augmentation Is a One-Way Ratchet

Once output increases:

* Deadlines tighten
* Standards rise
* Exceptions disappear

There is no return to pre-AI expectations.

---

## Who Actually Gets Augmented

AI benefits those who already have:

* Authority
* Decision rights
* Visibility

For everyone else, AI becomes a **performance multiplier** without leverage.

---

## The Hidden Cost of Augmentation

Augmented workers face:

* Higher throughput expectations
* Less tolerance for errors
* Faster burnout cycles

Efficiency is rewarded once.

Pressure is permanent.

## Conclusion

AI does not lighten workloads.

It **redefines what “normal” means**.
