--------------------------------------------

Speed used to signal competence.

Today, speed signals **commoditization**.

AI is infinitely fast.
Competing on speed is a losing game.

---

## Fast Is Easy to Replace

If output is judged primarily by:

* Volume
* Turnaround
* Responsiveness

Then AI already wins.

Humans who optimize for speed become benchmarks —
and benchmarks become automation targets.

---

## What Slows Humans Down (and Saves Them)

The safest professionals are slower because they:

* Think before acting
* Ask clarifying questions
* Consider second-order effects
* Carry responsibility

This friction is not inefficiency.

It is value.

---

## Speed Without Judgment Is Risk Transfer

Fast output shifts risk downstream:

* Errors surface later
* Accountability diffuses
* Trust erodes quietly

Organizations eventually pay for speed —
just not immediately.

---

## Conclusion

In the AI era, speed is cheap.

Judgment is not.

Optimize accordingly.
