-----------------------------------------------------

The first jobs AI removed were not senior roles.

They were **entry points**.

This was not a bug.
It was the most logical outcome.

## Junior Roles Exist for Inefficiency

Entry-level jobs historically served one purpose:

* Absorb mistakes
* Allow learning
* Trade speed for growth

AI offers output **without patience**.

That makes juniors economically unattractive.

---

## The Broken Ladder Problem

When junior roles disappear:

* Seniors age in place
* Mid-level roles hollow out
* Experience becomes scarce

The system saves money now —
and pays for it later.

---

## Why Companies Still Do It

Short-term incentives dominate:

* Quarterly performance
* Headcount efficiency
* Shareholder optics

Long-term talent pipelines are abstract costs.

AI makes short-term optimization irresistible.

---

## What This Means for New Entrants

The advice “just get experience” no longer works.

Experience now requires:

* Context
* Visibility
* Trust

Not time served.

---

## Conclusion

AI didn’t close the door behind you.

It removed the hallway entirely.
